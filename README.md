### Project Overview
Top-down emissions estimates are derived using atmospheric trace gas measurements and an atmospheric transport model that are fed into an inverse model. As one might expect, the uncertainty on the top-down emissions estimate comes from many factors. These include: observation uncertainty, atmospheric transport uncertainty, background mole fraction uncertainty, basis function uncertainty, aggregation error, etc. The question is what is the relative impact of calibration reference material uncertainties (used as part of the atmospheric trace gas measurements) within the top-down estimate? Are the atmospheric measurement standards imposed by the WMO/GAW for CO2 suitable for the level we need to quantify emissions? Furthermore, where did the "best practice" values for calibration reference materials for CO2 measurements originate?

This project aims to investigate the impact of uncertainties in calibration reference materials for CO2 on top-down emissions estimates. This is done by a series of simulation experiments using the UK as a testing ground. 

Why the UK? Well, the UK has been measuring atmospheric trace gases for over a decade using the UK DECC network. These atmospheric measurements have routinely been used to derive top-down emissions estimates which have been used to verify bottom-up / UNFCCC reported emissions estimates. The UK is one of 3 (maybe 4) countries in the world that does this independent verification. And has been doing it for the longest amount of time.

### Simulation Experiments
The simulation experiments investigated the impact of various calibration bias loadings (with and without added Gaussian noise). Biases were randomly imposed on each site used in the network configuration. This is to represent the situation of only some stations have calibration tanks with a bias. If all stations have a biased calibration tank (which might occur in some instances) they are effectively inter-calibrated with one another, but not necessarily on the same scale as other stations around the world. 

Two network configurations have been considered to explore the impact of network density on the calibration uncertainty. These network configurations are:
1. CBW + MHD
2. CBW+MHD+BSD+HFD+RGL+TAC+WAO
